      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">
      Prisoner's Dilemma</a> is a well-known "game" in game theory. In it,
      two prisoners are taken in by the police and asked to rat out the
      other. If neither comply, they are both given a short sentence,
      since there is no evidence on either. If both rat out the other,
      they each serve a medium sentence. But if just one rats out the other,
      and the other stays silent, the snitch gets away for free and the other
      serves a long sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simulation has two players choose to either "share" with or "steal"
      from another player. If both players share, they each get a point. If both
      steal, they each lose a point. If one steals and one shares, the stealer
      gets three points and the sharer loses three points. Each round, players
      face off against each other player twice. Next, the five players with the
      least amount of points are elimated. Then the points are reset, and the
      next round begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things make this simulation interesting: Each player has a pre-defined
      strategy that they use, and players remember the choices that the player
      they are facing has made in the past. A player's points may be reset after
      each round, but their "history" with another player is never reset.
      Strategies are often based on the past choices that the opponent made,
      such as Repeat, which simply copies the last choice the opponent made
      against them. When players are eliminated, they are replaced by new
      players with the strategies of the top five players. The game ends after
      fifteen rounds, or when one strategy has taken over the game.

      The graph was made using <a href=https://d3js.org>d3.js</a>, a JavaScript
      library that allows data to be presented and interacted with very nicely.
